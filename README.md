# e-Courts Captcha Solver

This project is a complete full-stack solution to automatically solve and fill captchas on the e-Courts judgments website. It consists of a Python FastAPI backend that runs an ONNX machine learning model and a Chrome Extension frontend that interacts with the webpage.

This was built as part of an internship assignment.

## Demo

*The extension automatically detects, solves, and fills the captcha in real-time.*

## Features

* **Automated Solving:** Automatically detects and solves the captcha on page load.
* **Auto-Fill:** Fills the captcha input box with the solved text.
* **Refresh Detection:** Automatically re-solves the captcha if the user clicks the "refresh" button.
* **ML Backend:** Uses a high-performance FastAPI server to run the `captcha.onnx` model.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, ONNX Runtime, `uvicorn`, Pillow, Torch
* **Frontend:** JavaScript (Chrome Extension API)
* **Model:** `captcha.onnx` (provided for the assignment)

## How It Works: The Approach (v1 vs. v2)

The main challenge was handling how the website serves its captcha.

### Initial Approach (v1 - "Simple Fetch")

The first version of the extension worked, but with a confusing side-effect. The extension would `fetch()` the captcha URL, which was a *new* request to the server. This created a "visibly wrong" mismatch, where the text in the box (Answer B) did not match the image on the screen (Image A).

**Note:** While visually confusing, this method **still works** and successfully bypasses the captcha. This is because the server's session is updated by the `fetch` request to expect "Answer B", which is exactly what the extension provides.

    E --> F[API solves Image B]
    F --> G[Extension fills Answer B]
    C --> H[Mismatch: Image A â‰  Answer B]
    G --> H
````

### Final Approach (v2 - "Observer + Canvas")

The final, robust version (`content.js` in the repo) solves this mismatch for a better user experience. It does **not** `fetch` a new image. Instead, it uses a `MutationObserver` (a "watchman") to wait for the *real* image to appear, and then uses a `<canvas>` (a "photocopier") to copy its pixels.

This way, the solved text always matches the visible image.

```mermaid

    A[Browser loads page] --> B[Server sends Image A]
    B --> C[User sees Image A]
    B --> D[Observer detects Image A]
    D --> E[Canvas copies Image A]
    E --> F[API solves Image A]
    F --> G[Extension fills Answer A]
    C --> H[Match: Image A = Answer A]
    G --> H
```

### Why v2? The Path to the Solution

The v1 approach was confusing, so I tried several other methods to fix the visual mismatch. These attempts failed and proved *why* v2 is the only correct approach.

  * **Attempt 1: The "Visual Fix"**

      * **What I tried:** I used `fetch` to get "Image B" and then tried to force the `<img>` tag on the page to display it (using `objectURL` or `dataURL`).
      * **Why it Failed:** The website's **Content Security Policy (CSP)** blocked this. The browser refused to load the new image, which broke the image element (showing "Catcha Text") and sent corrupt data to the backend.

  * **Attempt 2: The "Fetch Check"**

      * **What I tried:** I assumed the "Visual Fix" failed because the `fetch` was being blocked. I tried a cleaner `fetch` with error checking.
      * **Why it Failed:** This proved the server is smart. It detected my script was a "bot" (not a real `<img>` tag) and intentionally sent back **invalid junk data** instead of an image.

  * **The Solution (v2):**
    This is why v2 (`Observer` + `Canvas`) is the only robust method. It doesn't try to trick the server. It waits for the browser to load the image normally, then "photocopies" it from the screen. The server cannot detect or block this, as it's just reading pixels that are already visible.

## Setup and Installation

This project has two parts: the **server** (backend) and the **extension** (frontend).

### 1\. Backend Server

1.  Navigate to the `server/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Create the venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows (Git Bash)
    source venv/Scripts/activate

    # Or on Windows (CMD/PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2\. Frontend Extension

1.  Open the Google Chrome browser.
2.  Go to the extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
3.  Turn on the **"Developer mode"** toggle (usually in the top-right corner).
4.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5.  Select the `extension/` folder from this project.
6.  The "e-Courts Captcha Solver" will appear in your extensions list.

## How to Run

1.  **Start the Server:**
    Make sure your virtual environment is active in the `server/` directory, then run:

    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
    ```

    Your server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Use the Extension:**
    With the server running and the extension loaded, simply visit the e-Courts website:
    `https://judgments.ecourts.gov.in/pdfsearch/index.php`

    The captcha will be solved and filled in automatically.

```
